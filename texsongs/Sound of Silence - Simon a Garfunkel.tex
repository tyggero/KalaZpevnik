\beginsong{Sound of Silence}[by={Simon a Garfunkel}]
\num
\[Am]Hello, darkness, my old \[G]friend
I've come to talk with you a\[Am]gain
Because a vision softl\[F]{y cree}\[C]ping
Left its seeds while I w\[F]{as slee}\[C]ping
And the \[F]vision that was planted in my \[C]brain
Still re\[Am]mains
Within the \[G]sound of \[Am]silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence
\fin
\num
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence
\fin
\num
Fools, said I, you do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you
But my words like silent raindrops fell
\chordson
\[Am]And \[C]echoed in the \[G]wells of \[Am]silence
\fin
\num
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
\chordson
And the sign said~-- the \[F]words of the prophets
Are \[Am]written on the subway \[C]walls and tenement \[Am]halls
And whispered in the \[G]sounds of \[Am]silence
