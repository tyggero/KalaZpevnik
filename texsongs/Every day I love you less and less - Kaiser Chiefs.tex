\[E]Everyday I love you less and less
It's c\[E]lear to see that you've become obsessed
I \[Em]{got to} get this message to the press
That ev\[Em]eryday I love you less and less
And e\[E]veryday I love you less and less
I've \[E]got to get this feeling off my chest
The do\[Em]ctor says all I need is pills and rest
Since ev\[Em]eryday I love you less and \[F]less

Unless, un\[F]less, I know, I feel it in my bones
I'm s\[F]ick, I'm tired of staying in control
Oh y\[E]es, I feel, a rat upon a wheel
I \[E]got to know what's not and what is real
Oh \[F]yes, I'm stressed, I'm sorry I digress
Im\[F]pressed, you dressed to S.O.S
\[E]Ooh,\[D] and my parents \[G]love me \emph{(na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)}
\[E]Ooh,\[D] and my girlfriend \[G]loves me, \[A]ooh \emph{(na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)}

\[E]Everyday I love you less and less
I c\[E]an't believe once you and me did sex
It \[Em]makes me sick to think of you undressed
Since \[Em]everyday I love you less and less
And \[E]everyday I love you less and less
You're \[E]turning into something I detest
And e\[Em]verybody says that you're a mess
Since \[Em]everyday I love you less and less
