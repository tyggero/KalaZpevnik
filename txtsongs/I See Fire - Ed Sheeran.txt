Ed Sheeran - I See Fire


Int.Oh, misty eye of the mountain below
    Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
    And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
                               Em
    Keep watching over Durin's sons
 

                  Em     G
1.  If this is to end in fire
                   D        C
    Then we should all burn together
              Em           G    D        Am7
    Watch the flames climb high into the night
            Em    G         D            C
    Calling out father, oh, stand by and we will
              Am7         G/B           C
    Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
 
Sol.


                     Em    G
2.  And if we should die tonight
                   D       C
    Then we should all die together
            Em       G   D        Am7
    Raise a glass of wine for the last time
            Em    G         D          C
    Calling out father, oh, prepare as we will
              Am7         G/B           C
    Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
        Am7    G/B            C
    Desolation comes upon the sky
 

              Em  C  D          Em
R.  Now I see fire,  inside the mountain
          Em  C  D           Em
    I see fire,  burning the trees
              Em  C  D         Em
    And I see fire,  hollowing souls
          Em  C  D            Am7
    I see fire,  blood in the breeze
     
    And I hope that you'll remember me
 
Sol.

 

                  Em     G
3.  Oh, should my people fall
                D           C
    Then surely I'll do the same
                Em       G
    Confined in mountain halls
               D            Am7
    We got too close to the flame
            Em     G        D             C
    Calling out father, oh, hold fast and we will
              Am7         G/B           C
    Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side
        Am7    G/B            C
    Desolation comes upon the sky
 

              Em  C  D          Em
R.  Now I see fire,  inside the mountain
          Em  C  D           Em
    I see fire,  burning the trees
              Em  C  D         Em
    And I see fire,  hollowing souls
          Em  C  D            Am7
    I see fire,  blood in the breeze
                                    Am7
    And I hope that you'll remember me
 

               Am7      Em
M.  And if the night is burning
           G        D
    I will cover my eyes
               Am7    Em
    For if the dark returns then
       G             D
    My brothers will die
               Am7            Em
    And as the sky is falling down
               G                D
    It crashed into this lonely town
                  Am7
    And with that shadow upon the ground
      G/B     C                D
    I hear my people screaming out
 

              Em  C  D          Em
R.  Now I see fire,  inside the mountain
          Em  C  D           Em
    I see fire,  burning the trees
              Em  C  D         Em
    And I see fire,  hollowing souls
          Em  C  D            Em
    I see fire,  blood in the breeze
     
          Em           C                 D        Em
    I see fire, oh you know I saw a city burning (fire)
          Em         C                D     Em
    I see fire, feel the heat upon my skin (fire)
              Em   C       D  Em
    And I see fire, oooooo (fire)
     
              Em        C             D        Em
    And I see fire burn on and on the mountain side
